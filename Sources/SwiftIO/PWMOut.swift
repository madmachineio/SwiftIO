import CSwiftIO

/// The PWMOut class is used to generate periodic square waves and modulate the pulse
/// width to get different average output.
///
/// A PWM signal switches rapidly between on and off. The longer the output stays
/// high, the higher the average voltage. There are two key factors: the frequency
/// and duty cycle. **Frequency** defines the speed of on-off switching.
/// **Duty cycle** decides the proportion of high output in a period.
///
/// To start with, you need to initialize a pin as a PWMOut pin. A physical pin
/// may be connected to various internal peripherals and thus serve multiple
/// functionalities. You need to identify the specific pin using its id and specify
/// the pin's functionality before using it.
/// - `PWMOut` tells the pin's usage.
/// - `Id.PWM0A` defines which pin is used. You may refer to the board's pinout
/// which shows all pins and their corresponding functions in a diagram.
///
/// ```swift
/// let pin = PWMOut(Id.PWM0A)
/// ```
///
/// You can also set the default frequency and duty cycle of the PWM pin when
/// initializing it.
///
/// ```swift
/// let pin = PWMOut(Id.PWM0A, frequency: 1500, dutycycle: 0.5)
/// ```
///
/// - Important: The PWM pins with same number are paired, like PWM3A and PWM3B.
/// They can only share the same frequency.
///
/// ### Example 1: Light a LED with a specified brightness
///
/// ```swift
/// // Import the SwiftIO to use the related board functions.
/// import SwiftIO
/// // Import the MadBoard to decide which pin is used for the specific function.
/// import MadBoard
///
/// // Initialize a PWMOut pin PWM0A with default setting.
/// let led = PWMOut(Id.PWM0A)
///
/// // Setting the duty cycle to light the LED with half brightness.
/// led.setDutycycle(0.5)
///
/// while true {
///    sleep(ms: 1000)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this case, the duty cycle of PWM output affects the LED brightness, since it
/// sets the proportion of the LED on time during a period. The frequency of
/// the signal only changes how fast the LED turns on and off. As long as it is not
/// too low, the flicker will be unnoticeable.
///
/// ### Example 2: Make sound with a buzzer
///
/// ```swift
/// import SwiftIO
/// import MadBoard
///
/// let buzzer = PWMOut(Id.PWM0A, frequency: 0)
///
/// // Set the frequency of PWM to decide the sound pitch.
/// // The duty cycle can be any value bigger than 0 to generate sound.
/// buzzer.set(frequency: 1500, dutycycle: 0.5)
/// // Keep the sound for 1s.
/// sleep(ms: 1000)
/// // Suspend the PWM output to stop the sound.
/// buzzer.suspend()
///
/// while true {
///    sleep(ms: 1000)
/// }
/// ```
/// In this example, the sound from a buzzer relates to the movement of its internal
/// component. The faster the movement, the higher the pitch. So the frequency plays
/// an important role.

  /**
     Initializes a PWM output with the specified frequency and dutycycle.

     The pin name is required to initialize a PWM pin. PWM pins are marked with
     a tilde (~) on your board, but you'll need the board's pinout to find their
     specific id.

     ```swift
     // Initialize the pin PWM0A with other parameters set to default.
     let pin = PWMOut(Id.PWM0A)
     ```

     > Important: The pins with the same number are paired, like PWM3A and PWM3B.
     Ensure that pins within a group share the same frequency when utilizing them.

     You can also set the default frequency and duty cycle of the PWM output
     when initializing a pin:

     ```swift
     // Initialize the pin PWM0A with the frequency set to 2000Hhz and the dutycycle set to 0.5.
     let pin = PWMOut(Id.PWM0A, frequency: 2000, dutycycle: 0.5)
     ```

     - Parameter idName: **REQUIRED** Name/label for a physical pin which is
     associated with the PWM peripheral. See Id for the board in
     [MadBoards](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadBoards) library for reference.
     - Parameter frequency: **OPTIONAL** The frequency of the PWM signal in hertz,
     1000Hz by default.
     - Parameter dutycycle: **OPTIONAL** The percentage of time during a period
     in which the output is high, from 0.0 to 1.0. 0 by default.
