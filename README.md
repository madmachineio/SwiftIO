# SwiftIO

![SwiftIO pinout](https://github.com/madmachineio/SwiftIO/raw/master/images/swiftio_pinout.png)

A Swift framework for microcontrollers. The SwiftIO board provides a good way to learn Swift code. Write your code in the IDE, download to your board, and you'll get the results in real time if you've had the circuit connected.


## Documentation

The SwiftIO library provides an easy access to communicate with the external circuits simply by invoking the related classes/methods in the MadMachine IDE. You can read or write the digital and analog signal, as well as using the communication protocol.
